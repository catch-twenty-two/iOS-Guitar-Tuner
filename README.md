Open Source iOS Guitar Tuner

This is the source code and project for a guitar tuner I released to the iTunes app store ages ago, before that it was freeware for Mac OS X.  I had many people interested in what the code looked like so here it is.  Hopefully the community can contribute and learn from it and maybe even make it better.  It should work out of the box and was tested with X Code 5.02/iOS 7.  Prior to that it worked with iOS 5.
